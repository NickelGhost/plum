# Plum Package Manager
A "package manager" made by Gabriel "NickelGhost" Karczewski.

It's just a project for personal use - a quick way to get software that isn't outdated, as well as quickly make packages with pre-compiled binaries.

The project is licensed under MIT license, found in LICENSE file.

## Configuration
To run in a local environment, just change settings in config.yml, add bin folder to your path, and you're good to go!

Alternatively, you can run included ubuntu_installer.rb, which I made for this project. I tested it on ubuntu, but it should work on most Linux systems with bash. There are lots of improvements to be made about it, but it works :D

## Making Packages
Coming soon! For now, just check out how current packages are made - use "plum download <package>" and study its plum.yml file.

## Creating a Repo
Coming soon! For now, just study how the default FTP server is structured.
